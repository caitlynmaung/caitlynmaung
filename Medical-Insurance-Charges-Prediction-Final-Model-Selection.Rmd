```{r}
insurance <- read.csv("~/Downloads/insurance.csv")
```

```{r}
install.packages("ppcor")
```

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
names(insurance)
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
# excluding categorical variables
numeric.variables <- insurance[sapply(insurance, is.numeric)]
datamatrix <- cor(numeric.variables)
corrplot(datamatrix,method = "number")
```

```{r}
library(ppcor)
```

```{r}
pcor(numeric.variables,method = "pearson")
```
After creating a correlation matrix between the numeric variables (not categorical) in the model,we computed the t-statistics and corresponding p values for the independent variables and tested whether there was highly significant correlations (p-value << 0.01) between the variables. 
High correlation between variables indicates that we could possibly remove them from the model since they provide similar information. 

We found a high correlation between age and charges (p-value = 5.533923e-26), 
and bmi and charges for the house (p-value = 1.354882e-10).
Since charges is the Y variable, we can conclude there is no significant correlation between age and bmi as X variables.

After this, we needed to use model selection techniques to pick the regressors in our final model.
Our goal is interpretation so we need the correct model.
When comparing models of different sizes, we use the Bayes information criterion (BIC) as our model selection criteria. The goal is to minimize BIC because it tends to pick the correct model.


Full model is:
charges = -11938.5 + 256.9(age) -131.3(sexmale) + 339.2(bmi) + 475.5(children) + 23848.5(smokeryes) -353(regionnorthwest) - 1035(regionsoutheast) - 960(regionsouthwest)
```{r}
full.model = lm(charges~., insurance)
summary(full.model)
empty.model = lm(charges~1, insurance)
summary(empty.model)
```

```{r}
#normal Q-Q plot
qqnorm(full.model$residuals)
qqline(full.model$residuals)
```

We can observe that the plot is non-normal because there are points that deviate from the line, there are outliers, and that there is no obvious pattern.

```{r}
the.SWtest = shapiro.test(full.model$residuals)
the.SWtest
```
The errors are not normally distributed.


How many possible models:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
formulas = map(1:5, ~ combn(paste0("x",1:5), .x) %>% 
      apply(., 2, function(v) paste0("y ~ ", paste(v, collapse=" + ")))) %>% 
  unlist

formulas
```


Forward-Backward AND Backward-Forward step-wise selection
```{r}
# FB = forward-backward
FB.model.BIC = stepAIC(empty.model,  scope = list(lower = empty.model, upper= full.model), k = log(n),trace=FALSE,direction = "both")
FB.model.BIC

# BF = backward-forward
BF.model.BIC = stepAIC(full.model,  scope = list(lower = empty.model, upper= full.model), k = log(n),trace=FALSE,direction = "both")
BF.model.BIC

FB.model.BIC$coefficients
BF.model.BIC$coefficients
```
We can see that BF and FB stepwise selection with BIC agree.

Thus our final model:
charges = -12102.8 + 257.8(age) + 321.9(bmi) + 473.5(children) + 23811.4(smokeryes)
Note that sex and region are dropped here.

```{r}
#fitting the model
my.model = lm(charges~ age + bmi + children + smoker, insurance)
summary(my.model)
```
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(my.model)
```

#check assumptions for the final model
```{r}
qqnorm(my.model$residuals)
qqline(my.model$residuals)
```
```{r}
the.SWtest = shapiro.test(my.model$residuals)
the.SWtest
```

```{r}
best.model <- my.model
ei.s = best.model$residuals/sqrt(sum(best.model$residuals^2)/(nrow(insurance) - length(best.model$coefficients)))

ri = rstandard(best.model)

ti = rstudent(best.model)

par(mfrow =c(2,2))

hist(ei.s,main ="Semi-studentized/standardized residuals")
hist(ri,main="Studentized/Standardized residuals")
hist(ti, main="Deleted Residuals")

# identify outliers

alpha = 0.1 ; n = nrow(insurance); p = length(best.model$coefficients)
cutoff = qt(1-alpha/(2*n), n -p )
cutoff
```

```{r}
cutoff.deleted = qt(1-alpha/(2*n), n -p -1 )
cutoff.deleted
```

```{r}
outliers = which(abs(ei.s)> cutoff | abs(ri) > cutoff | abs(ti) > cutoff.deleted)
outliers
```

```{r}
insurance.no.outlier <- insurance[!outliers]
insurance.no.outlier
```
